# Moodle h5p multiple choice multiple correct solver!
Goes through whole video and auto solves every mutliple choice multiple correct it finds, leaving the rest for user to do if they want to.

For questions not solvable by this code, the code stops till user provides input in terminal, allowing users to solve and submit/ skip and submit. Though there's a bit of a catch in getting the code up and running again and this is really important - **You have to make sure that the quiz dialogue box(the one where you can see the options) and the quiz button (the purple circle) both disappear before letting the code run again.**

# Instructions 
Just run `solver.py` , input your username, password and the URL for moodle lecture (Terminal will ask for these inputs, paste using `ctrl+shift+v`).

Install selenium (python library) or any other library the terminal bugs you about
