# Moodle h5p multiple choice multiple correct solver!
Goes through whole video and auto solves every mutliple choice multiple correct it finds, leaving the rest for user to do if they want to.

For questions not solvable by this code, the code stops for 200 seconds, allowing users to solve and submit/ skip and submit. Though there's a bit of a catch in getting the code up and running again. You have to make sure that the quiz dialogue box and the quiz button both disappear and then input in the console to go ahead (just an enter key)

# instructions
